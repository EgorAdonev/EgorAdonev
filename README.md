- 👋 Hi, I’m @EgorAdonev
- 👀 I’m mostly interested in AI, Neural Networks, Machine Learning(Python) and Java Development. I want to share with you my projects,
who knows maybe somebody with front-end or application design skills would love to make an app that decodes ADS-B using my Neural Networks and ML
(I would love also to meet smbdy with NN and ML deep experience to improve my neural networks skills).
So that's my second making NNs using Python and Tensorflow. These are for decoding ADS-B signals (made in Google Colab cloud environment using .ipynb and Python).
The 1st network is the network that is for classification of ADS-B packet(or signal-whatever you like) (1 - short packet, 2 - extended packet, 0 - noise).
Second one is for bit decoding, so on the output we have actual(sometimes incorrect) bits.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Computer Science.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on machine learning, deep learning, neural networks.

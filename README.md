- 👋 Hi, I’m @EgorAdonev
- 👀 I’m mostly interested in Java, Automated/Unit testing, Neural Networks. And I want to share my projects with you.
So that's my NN model that has been developed using Python and Tensorflow. Model consists of 2 NNs are for decoding ADS-B signals (made in Google Colab cloud environment using .ipynb and Python).
The 1st network is the network that used is for classification of ADS-B packet(or signal-whatever you like) (1 - short packet, 2 - extended packet, 0 - noise).
Second one is for bit decoding, on the output we have actual(sometimes incorrect) bits.
- 🌱 Computer Science MSc.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on machine learning, deep learning, neural networks.
